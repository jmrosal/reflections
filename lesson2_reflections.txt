What happens when you initialize a repository? Why do you need to do it?
Just to git init. No commit is created and not file is tracked. Only the
.git directory is created.


How is the staging area different from the working directory and the
repository? What value do you think it offers?
it is just a bunch of files whose change are being tracked.
