What happens when you initialize a repository? Why do you need to do it?
Just to git init. No commit is created and not file is tracked. Only the
.git directory is created.


How is the staging area different from the working directory and the
repository? What value do you think it offers?
it is just a bunch of files whose change are being tracked.

How can you use the staging area to make sure you have one commit per
logical change?
Just stage those files under the same logical change.


How do the diagrams help you visualize the branch structure?
They help us understand the reachability of each branch.
