How did viewing a diff between two versions of a file help you see the
bug that was introduced?
Making starking clear their differences.

How could having easy access to the entire history of a file make you
a more efficient programmer in the long term?
Much easier to trace back privious works and thoghts.

Why do you think some version control systems, like Git, allow saving
multiple files in one commit, while others, like Google Docs, treat
each file separately?
Because we are thinking in terms interelated files, meaning projects.
